# Graphics
I am second year IT engineering student. I am a aspiring graphic designer. I know I do not have much to show now for my skills, except of my some edits, which I hope give you some idea of my creativeness and ability to come up with new ideas and concepts. I am currently learning 3D art and Illustration, and I hope to explore different designers tools down the road.
